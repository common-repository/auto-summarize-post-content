### How do the plugin works? 

The "Auto Summarize Post Content" plugin operates by employing a two-step process to generate summaries.

Firstly, it identifies the most repeated words within the post content. By analyzing the frequency of occurrence, the plugin determines which words are the most significant and likely to convey the key points of the text.

Secondly, the plugin applies a custom function to remove any irrelevant or insignificant words from the identified list of repeated words. This function filters out unnecessary terms, such as common articles, prepositions, and other words that do not contribute substantially to the overall meaning of the content.

By combining these two steps, the "Auto Summarize Post Content" plugin intelligently generates a concise summary that highlights the essential information within the post. This summary is then displayed at the top or bottom of the post, providing readers with a quick and informative overview before they delve into the complete article.
